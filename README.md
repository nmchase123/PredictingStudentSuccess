# Predicting Student Success

Hey! This is a project I did to try predicting whether students pass their final year based on different factors like study habits, family background, and school activities.  

---

## What I Did

- Used the **UCI Student Performance dataset**.  
- Cleaned the data and turned the final grade into a **pass/fail label**.  
- Converted categorical features into numbers (like yes/no to 1/0) and one-hot encoded stuff like parents' jobs.  
- Built a **Perceptron model from scratch** in Python to predict student success.  
- Split the data into training and testing sets and checked how well the model did.

## Skills & Tools

- **Python:** pandas, numpy  
- **Visualization:** seaborn, matplotlib  
- **ML stuff:** Perceptron, train-test split, accuracy calculation  
- **Dataset:** UCI Machine Learning Repository (via `ucimlrepo`)  

---

## Results

- The model got around **88% accuracy** on the test set!  
- Made plots to see distributions of grades and some differences by gender and other features.
